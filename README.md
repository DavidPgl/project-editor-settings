# Project-Editor-Settings (PES)
A small godot addon for saving editor and project settings.

Allows to apply settings (Editor as well as Project) per project on start.

## Usage
- Define settings inside the `config.ini` file
- The `key` is the path of the setting
  - For the debug port it would be `network/debug/remote_port`
 - Spaces need to be replaced with underscores

Example setting you want to change:
